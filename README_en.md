# Introduction to the warehouse.
This warehouse is used to store torrent files or magnet links that we create ourselves or obtain from the Internet, and to share them according to the resources; it aims to facilitate individuals to store relevant resources or provide resources for others.

# Resource Purpose
All resources shared in this repository (including but not limited to torrent files and magnet links) are either homemade or from the Internet. If the content of the resources does not comply with the local laws or relevant regulations in your area, this repository will not bear any responsibility. Users should judge for themselves whether the resources are legal and compliant, and promptly delete any illegal content.
This repository welcomes all users to maintain or improve the resource content together. If you find any problems or have any suggestions for improvement, please feel free to submit an issue or a pull request.

# Resource Tracker server.
All the self-made resources in this warehouse use the Tracker server list provided by the [TrackersListCollection] project (https://github.com/XIU2/TrackersListCollection).

- Note:
  - In the above naming rules, the content in () is optional, and you can fill it in according to the actual situation.
  - If the resource is from mainland China or does not have a Chinese translation, you can omit the content in ().
  - For the unified resource naming convention, all resource information is defaulted to be taken from the [TMDB] (https://www.themoviedb.org/) site. If there is no relevant information on this site, the tmdbid entry will not be filled out.
  - The premiere year is the premiere time node in the resource area, which does not include the release time in other countries.
  - In anime resources, "里"/"性" represent that the anime resources are "里番资源", that is, the content includes depictions of sexual behavior. "性" represents that the anime resources include depictions of sexual organs or metaphors but without actual depictions of sexual behavior.
  - This repository resource defaults to include simplified Chinese subtitles. If the resource does not have simplified Chinese subtitles, we will add a [No Subtitles/Traditional Chinese] notation after the resource name.
  - If the resource contains special content that needs to be noted, it will be marked at the end of the torrent file's name.
